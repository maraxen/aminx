"""PottsMPNN knob semantics at the driver level, driven through PottsMPNNOptions.

``test_potts_knobs.py`` covers knobs reachable at the function that implements
them. Those establish the semantics but not the plumbing: several
``PottsMPNNOptions`` fields turn out to be read nowhere outside their own
dataclass (aminx debt 2435, guarded by ``tests/lint/test_options_plumbing.py``), a
gap a model-level test cannot see. The tests here go through ``score()`` with a
real ``ScoringSpecification`` carrying real options, so a knob that is declared and
wired to nothing fails them.

The model is a random-init ``PottsMPNN`` serialised to ``tmp_path`` -- no
checkpoint download -- so this level is cheap enough to be the default for any knob
consumed in host code rather than in a pure function.
